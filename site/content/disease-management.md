Based on our reference database and trained classifiers, users who generate new nanopore sequences from unknown bacterial DNA can derive clinically and epidemiologically relevant information to answer the three main questions that aquaculture producers have during a disease outbreak.

## What is killing my aquatic animals? {#identification}

Identify a bacterial pathogen at the genus and species levels
Fine epidemiology using multi-locus sequence type (MLST) data to determine the origin, track spread and evolution of bacterial disease outbreaks 

## How can I treat my aquatic animals? {#treatment}

When there is a disease outbreak, treatment of the current situation.

Potential preventative measures include probiotics, vaccination, management of the environment, and improved biosecurity. Treatment with antibiotics can be used to treat fish diseases caused by bacteria. With ready access to antibiotics coupled to limited availability of veterinary support, aquatic disease control with antibiotics is poorly informed, often unrecorded and likely to be high in many countries where aquaculture growth is fastest. 

There are over 67 antibiotics used in 11 aquaculture producing countries. Overuse and misuse of antibiotics present an increasing risk of developing antibiotic resistant bacteria, a phenomenon also known as antimicrobial resistance (AMR). AMR has been declared as one of the most serious threats to global public health with attention now focused on global food supply. 

Safe antibiotic use based on data-driven decisions under health professional supervision will be key to reduce their overall use in aquaculture.

- Can raw nanopore reads be used to correctly infer AMR phenotype of streptococcal fish pathogens (Streptococcus iniae and S. agalactiae) from an in-house database? Work in progress (coming in 2022).

## How can I prevent disease in the next crops? {#prevent}

Prevention of re-occurrence of a disease must be considered. Vaccination of farmed fish with locally produced autogenous vaccines against bacterial disease can provide a locally-driven, cost-effective means to protect those animals, reduce antibiotic use and therefore address the global antibiotic resistance problem. 

Molecular serotyping/biotyping information is used to categorize pathogenic members from different bacterial groups. Such information is used to produce/re-formulate autogenous vaccines and is of primary importance to ensure that vaccines cover outbreak isolates in a particular region.

- Our AquaPathRapIdS reference database and in-built classifiers can now accurately identify multiple serotypes of two major fish pathogens (S. agalactiae and Y. ruckeri).

## Are my aquatic animals safe for human consumption? {#human-safety}

Transmission of zoonotic and foodborne diseases between animals and humans through consumption or during handling and preparation of infected aquatic animals pose serious concerns for public health and food safety.
In 2015, Streptococcus agalactiae ST-283 caused a foodborne disease outbreak involving over 100 people in Singapore (Rajendram et al., 2016).
In xxxx, S. iniae infections were reported in humans after handling or consuming infected fish (Hansen et al., 2013).
For example, the non-cholera vibrio: Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a frequent cause of food poisoning and septicaemia in humans (Baker-Austin et al., 2017), although mostly via marine and brackish water shellfish.
Our AquaPathRapIdS reference database includes all the major known GBS sequence types with our classifiers trained to detect them including ST-283, allowing for early detection of those zoonose risks in aquatic food products before reaching consumers.
