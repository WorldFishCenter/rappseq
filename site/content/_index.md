    Lab in a Backpack is a workflow for rapid identification of aquaculture pathogens.

    Traditional methods are slow, expensive, and do not have enough resolution to precisely know what's killing the animals in your aquaculture farm. It can be hard to know the best way forward. 
    
    Lab in a Backpack will help you identify aquaculture pathogens so you can make better decisions to protect your animals and your people.
