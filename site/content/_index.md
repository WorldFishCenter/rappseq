    AquaPath is an Rapid Identification System for Aquaculture Pathogens.

    Traditional methods are slow, expensive, and do not have enough resolution to precisely know what's killing the animals in your farm. 
    
    Coupled with the lab-in-a-backpack, AquaPath will help you to identify exactly what's the pathogen that's killing your animals so you can make decisions.

        ### Extract and sequence pathogen DNA
      
        Send the samples to a nearby lab where a trained operator will extract the DNA from pathogens in the sample and generate nanopore sequences.
