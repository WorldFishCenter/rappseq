    AquaPath is a cloud based tool for rapid identification of aquaculture pathogens.

    Traditional methods are slow, expensive, and do not have enough resolution to precisely know what's killing the animals in your aquaculture farm. It can be hard to know the best way forward. 
    
    Coupled with the lab-in-a-backpack, AquaPath will help you identify aquaculture pathogens so you can make better decisions to protect your animals and your people.

    ## Three simple steps to better information

    If you already have DNA sequences in a FASTQ format you can use our online identification tool straight away. If not, don't worry, getting the DNA is easier and more cost-efficient than you might think.

        ### Extract and sequence pathogen DNA
      
        Send the samples to a nearby lab where a trained operator will extract the DNA from pathogens in the sample and generate nanopore sequences.
